I think we could use above table for damage from player and monste

need to calculate armor class ofr player
base
no armor 2
leather armor 5
chain mail 8
plate mail 11
add luck/5 -1, + agility/2 -2, dext/4 -1 
player with luck 10, agility 10 and dext 10 has ac of...
plate mail 11 + 1 luck + 3 agility and 1 dext =16
ac of 16 means that the monster needs 16 or bettr on a 20 sided die to hit
then use damage on above chart with monster's name to roll damage.
also, the monster should have attack adjustment -3 to +3 changing to hit 
on original player ac from 13 to 19.

I think monsters need:
hit points, attack adjustment, base AC and name

I thinkthat the monsterEncounter function can take  in the weapon damage and monster stuff from txt file then adjust these values al then call
monster.setHP(int)
monster.setPlayerToHit(1 to 20)
monster.setMonsterToHit(1 to 20);
monster.setDamage(int die, int rolls) 
maybe we need a monsterCombat class ?
then in monsterCombat function call get functions and do the combat.

just wanted to share what I am thinking talk to you tomorrow

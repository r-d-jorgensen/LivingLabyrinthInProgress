Oh, No! There are a bunch of boulders rolling toward you!
Whew, you were able to avoid them with your agility.
You get knocked overand rolled over by one.
Whoa! You are falling into a hole!
Way to go, you were able to catch yourself on the edge before falling in.
Damn. You were unable to avoid falling in. you get  pierced by a spike.
There is a spear flying at you!
You nimbly get out of the way. Most impressive.
You are unable to get out of the way. It pierces you.
Yikes! You fall into a pit of snakes!
Somehow you jumped out of the pit before any of them could bite you.
aahhgh! You are bitten before being able to jump out.
Oh crap! There is a griffin coming at you with its claws ready to grab you!
Good job, you were able to evade the creature. The griffin flies away
Ouch! The griffin grabs you and drops you off about 100 feet away.
